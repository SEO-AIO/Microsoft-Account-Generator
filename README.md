# microsoft-account-gen
Simple Selenium script that generates a new outlook/microsoft account with random credentials.
This script was made mainly to create accounts to use in videogames and nowhere else.
Make sure to use a VPN or a Proxy before generating the account. (you can also use your phone hotspot, you just need to have a different IP every time you generate an account)

DO NOT USE THIS SCRIPT FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES. I DO NOT ASSUME ANY LIABILITY FOR HOW YOU WILL USE THIS SCRIPT.
