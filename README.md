# Microsoft Account Generator - READ THIS
Simple Selenium script that generates a new outlook/microsoft account with random credentials.
This script was made mainly to create accounts to use in videogames and nowhere else.
Make sure to use a VPN or a Proxy before generating the account. (you can also use your phone hotspot, you just need to have a different IP every time you generate an account)

The ONLY thing that's manual is the bot verification, so when it appears click next and complete the verification, after that don't touch anything else.

Once you see this message "Successfully generated a new Microsoft account!" you can close the Chrome driver and PotatoGen. (The account info will be stored in "account.txt")

Do NOT save or click anything on the Chrome driver appart from the bot verification.

This script might output some errors but unless PotatoGen closes or the driver closes it wont be a big problem.

DO NOT USE THIS SCRIPT FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES. I DO NOT ASSUME ANY LIABILITY FOR HOW YOU WILL USE THIS SCRIPT.
