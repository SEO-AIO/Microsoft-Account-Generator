# Microsoft Account Generator - READ THIS
Simple Selenium script that generates a new outlook/microsoft account with random credentials.

# Purpose

This script was made mainly to create accounts to use in videogames and nowhere else.

# Main Requirements

Make sure to use a VPN, Proxy or your phone Hotspot before generating the account. (you can generate max 3 accounts per IP)

# Manual Steps

The ONLY thing that's manual is the bot verification, so when it appears click next and complete the verification, after that DON'T touch anything else.

# Saving Information

Don't save any account or any type of information on the Chrome Driver. It is NOT safe and its useless.

The Chrome Driver is not in any way connected to the normal Chrome Browser so your information won't be remembered or stored.

# Errors

If PotatoGen closes randomly try to open it from cmd so you can read the error.

# Accounts

Once you see this message "Successfully generated a new Microsoft account!" you can close the Chrome Driver and PotatoGen. (The account info will be stored in "accounts.txt")

The accounts will NOT overwrite the old accounts so you don't have to rename or move the file "accounts.txt".

# Chrome Driver
The Chrome Driver will automatically install once you open "PotatoGen.py".

# IMPORTANT
DO NOT USE THIS SCRIPT FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES. I DO NOT ASSUME ANY LIABILITY FOR HOW YOU WILL USE THIS SCRIPT.
